# Real-time-Data-Ingestion-and-Storage
## Real-time Data Ingestion and Storage from Wikimedia Recent Changes Stream using Apache Kafka, Spring Boot, and MySQL

# Project Description:
This project involves creating a real-time data pipeline that captures live data from the Wikimedia Recent Changes stream using Apache Kafka. Leveraging Spring Boot, the project processes and parses incoming JSON messages to extract meaningful information related to edits and updates across Wikimedia projects. The parsed data is then seamlessly stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and analysis. This project demonstrates the integration of Apache Kafka for stream processing, Spring Boot for application development, and MySQL for structured data storage, offering a scalable and robust solution for real-time data management.
